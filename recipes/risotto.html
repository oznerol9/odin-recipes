        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Classic, relatively inexpensive, and easy to make, this creamy risotto recipe is on point. The result feels lavish, without having to go to an upscale restaurant.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups (1 quart) chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot, chopped (about 1/2 cup; or 1/2 small onion, chopped)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth (or dry white wine)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. Lower the heat so the stock stays hot while you cook the risotto.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains are coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another minute or so, until there is a slightly nutty aroma. Make sure not to let the rice turn brown.</li>
            <li>Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir every once in a while until the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process.</li>
            <li>Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for about 20 minutes or until the grains are tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy (al dente).</li>
            <li>Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve in bowl and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
