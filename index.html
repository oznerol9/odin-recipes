        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>A baked dish containing layers of boiled lasagna, and usually cheese, a seasoned sauce of tomatoes, and meat or vegetables.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
            <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans canned tomatoes sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons with sugar</li>
            <li>Enough is enough</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce </strong>with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheese ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives lasagna the flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
        </ol>
